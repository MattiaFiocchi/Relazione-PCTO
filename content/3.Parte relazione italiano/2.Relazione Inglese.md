# Relazione Inglese

I am Mattia Fiocchi, a student from the 5th CIA class at Allievi Sangallo School. In 2023, I had the opportunity to do an internship at Ricciutelli Tende company, under the guidance of my company tutor, Ricciutelli Cristina, and my school tutor, Teresa Ricci. On the first day of the internship, Cristina introduced herself, and I did the same. She showed me around the workplace and explained in detail what I would be doing for the next two weeks. My task was to create a website to list the components necessary for building sun blinds. The company is specifically involved in the production of sun blinds. During my internship, I did not have the opportunity to work closely with other employees. The required knowledge and skills were related to HTML and CSS code. My main task was to create the website. Despite my difficulties in putting the website online, I still made significant improvements in my programming skills. I mainly used the "Visual Studio Code" program for coding and Chrome to view the homepage. I really enjoyed this experience because I had the opportunity to put into practice what I learned at school and had to meet deadlines as a real employee would. I felt truly involved in the work and derived great satisfaction from completing the project. I am grateful for the opportunity I was given and hope to apply the skills I have acquired in future work experiences.tivo.
